    "Our reliance on single-use plastic water bottles is more than simply wasteful; "
    "it is bad for our environment because of the composition of the bottles themselves "
    "and the chemicals they release as they break down in our landfills. Single-use plastic "
    "water bottles cause dangerous substances to ‚Äúleach‚Äù into the soil and water (Macklin). "
    "The bottles typically don‚Äôt begin to break down for one hundred years, or even longer. "
    "As they break down, they release dangerous chemicals like bisphenol-A into the soil. "
    "Bisphenol-A is an endocrine disruptor, i.e., it can affect the levels of hormones within "
    "the human body, creating disease. As these chemicals accumulate in the soil, they eventually sink "
    "into the water table, contaminating the water (O‚ÄôConnor)."
